# Dragons

Dragons are a versatile race, though their main home is [Kyrheim](/places/kyrheim.md). They are inherently magical beings, though not inherently powerful. All dragons are furred, and differences between different groups of dragons are similar to dog breeds - dragons that live in colder climates might have thicker fur, whereas dragons that live in the mountains and are flying more often have wider wingspans.

Dragons live mostly separated from the other races, and there is a large cultural divide between the two groups. Dragons are seen as beasts in the eyes of many, uncivilized and bloodthirsty. Part of the reason for this reputation is because of the fact that dragon society is heavily focused on glory and wealth, and most dragons will happily kill someone with a lot of gold to take their wealth.[^2] This has been changing though, as more and more dragons have been interacting with the rest of the world. At the same time, a newer generation of dragons is growing up, and they aren't as fixated on wealth and glory as previous generations.

[^2]: This is perfectly fine, I'm just too used to Corlinth dragons which fell under the category of "they're just misunderstood"
