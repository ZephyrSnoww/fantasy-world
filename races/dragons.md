# Dragons

Dragons are a versatile race, though their main home is [Kyrheim](/places/kyrheim.md). They are inherently magical beings, and part of how that magic manifests is their ability to adapt to any environment they are in. Dragons will adapt to the climate they're in within a few months of being there, faster if the dragon is more powerful or is intentionally using their magic to adapt.[^1]

Dragons live mostly separated from the other races, and there is a large cultural divide between the two groups. Dragons are seen as beasts in the eyes of many, uncivilized and bloodthirsty. Part of the reason for this reputation is because of the fact that dragon society is heavily focused on glory and wealth, and most dragons will happily kill someone with a lot of gold to take their wealth.[^2] This has been changing though, as more and more dragons have been interacting with the rest of the world. At the same time, a newer generation of dragons is growing up, and they aren't as fixated on wealth and glory as previous generations.

[^1]: I know I had a part in this idea, but it doesn't resonate with me 'n I don't know why. Just not in love with it ig? I feel like we could make it trans coded if we try to lean into it, but idk
[^2]: This is perfectly fine, I'm just too used to Corlinth dragons which fell under the category of "they're just misunderstood"[^3]
[^3]: Can I put a footnote in a footnote?[^4]
[^4]: apparently, wtf
