- if we're just goin with a normal, earth-like world (ie, spherical) then id like to have somthing unique like additional suns or moons

- so far our worlds only defining characteristic is "being furry". thats not a ton to build off of, and id really like some additional ideas, but i hame some related ideas
-   first thing i think of is that video called like "Autism, Furries, God" or whatever the fuck. kindof a random connection but, idk, having something about some fundamental creative force diety could be a thing
-     idk how you make a "god of autism and creation"  but thats what comes to mind
