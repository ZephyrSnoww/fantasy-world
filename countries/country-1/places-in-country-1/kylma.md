# Kylma

Kylma[^1] is a forest in the northern parts of [Country 1](/countries/country-1/country-1.md). It's located near [Velusia](/countries/country-1/velusia/velusia.md). It has moderate summers with relatively warm weather, and very snowy winters.

[^1]: Name's a bit brief. for forests or geographic features, youd expect to see something like "XXXwood" or "XXX Forest" Like Mirkwood from LotR for example. It's not to say it doesnt work, but it sounds a bit off to me
