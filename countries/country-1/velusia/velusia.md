# Velusia

Valusia is a large city in the upper parts of [Country 1](/countries/country-1/country-1.md). It's located near [Kylma](/countries/country-1/places-in-country-1/kylma.md). Velusia gets relatively mild summers, warm but not hot, and cold winters with lots of snow.[^1]

[^1]: sounds Italian, dunno if thats the vibe of the city you where going for? not saying it doesnt work, but it envokes a more equatorial/humid climate
