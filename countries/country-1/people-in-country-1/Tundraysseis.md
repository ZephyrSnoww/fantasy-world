# Tundraysseis, Bringer of Death

- Furred dragon
- Lives in the wilderness outside of [Velusia](/countries/country-1/velusia/Velusia.md)
- Has built a little makeshift place for herself

## Brainstorming

- she really just wants to make her own little place
    - maybe wants to be able to share it with others?
        - ~~sad she cant because people fear her?~~
        - not even aware people fear her?
            - this sort of brings up name issues
            - ~~does she just not know the second half of the name people use for her?~~
                - ~~how did people learn her first name then?~~
            - does she know her full name and just think its funny and incorrect?
                - dragons are given names like that by their parents at birth
                - she just thinks its comedic how her parents apparently wanted her to bring death and shes just chilling (?)
                    - bad relationship with parents?
                    - whats her personal life even like
    - she still tries to fit in with dragons
    - when she sees people she tries to act threatening
        - usually succeeds just because people are afraid of dragons regardless of what they're doing, really
    - even if she isn't like other dragons she still grew up around them and thus has some of their ideas
    - grew up being told that people are inferior to dragons
        - people are just lesser beings, not nearly as prestigious or powerful or beautiful as any dragon
        - thus dragons can do whatever they want to them and it's justified
    - told that people are hostile towards dragons because they're jealous of their magnificence
        - people are either jealous and attack or jealous and afraid of their prowess

### Personal Life

- family gave her a name that is just wrong
- stereotypical "not like the other dragons" maybe
- doesn't want to hurt people
    - why, what sets her apart from other dragons?
        - most other dragons just accept it?
        - dragon society based off of glory (killing/terrorizing ppl?)
            - maybe not killing specifically but, how much gold you have or whatever
            - so most dragons try to get more gold by just killing rich people or whatever
            - dragons instinctually like shinies?
                - tundra still has that instinct, just pursues it in different ways?
                - oh my god shes autistic i made an autistic dragon
                - yeah that makes sense i fuckin would do that
    - ostracized from most other dragons because she doesn't conform to what they value in a dragon
    - lives far from most other dragons
    - keeps to herself mostly
    - seen as an easy target?
        - dragons don't bother her because she doesn't bother them at all and she just isn't a threat
            - she also just isn't worth killing or anything because there's no prestige there
        - people see her as an easy target?
            - hasn't been attacked yet because she's new in the area?
            - or just, people know she's on her own and far from any other dragons, but she's still a dragon and nearly everyone is still very afraid of that alone
            - combo of both probably
    - moved to where she is relatively recently
    - was driven out of where she lived previously?
        - by dragons or by people?
