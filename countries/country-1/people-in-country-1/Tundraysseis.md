# Tundraysseis, Bringer of Death

Tundraysseis, or Tundra, is a young adult furred dragon with black and grey fur and light pink accent coloring. She recently moved into the forest outside of [Velusia](/countries/country-1/velusia/Velusia.md), and has built a makeshift little place to live in the time she's been there. She's soft, and while she's not incompetent, she's not the brightest either. She can survive on her own, but that's greatly helped by the fact that she's one of the largest mammalian species on the planet and thus doesn't have to worry about predators very much.

## Childhood

She grew up in dragon society, raised by parents that felt very strongly about draconic beliefs. Growing up, she was told that humanoid species are lesser than dragons, and will attack out of jealousy or fear. Her parents tried to teach her to value glory and prestige, and see gold as valuable above all else. She never understood it, but could pretend well enough to pass just fine. She never went out of her way to collect gold, though, which her parents noticed. Her attention was grabbed by

- Furred dragon
- Young adult
- Lives in the forest outside of [Velusia](/countries/country-1/velusia/Velusia.md)
    - Only started living in the forest relatively recently
    - Has built a little makeshift place for herself
- Doesn't want to hurt people
- Grew up in a society that is very focused on glory and riches, and thus hurting people
- Struggles with thinking humanoids are "lesser" than dragons

## Brainstorming

- she really just wants to make her own little place
    - maybe wants to be able to share it with others?
        - ~~sad she cant because people fear her?~~
        - not even aware people fear her?
            - this sort of brings up name issues
            - ~~does she just not know the second half of the name people use for her?~~
                - ~~how did people learn her first name then?~~
            - does she know her full name and just think its funny and incorrect?
                - dragons are given names like that by their parents at birth
                - she just thinks its comedic how her parents apparently wanted her to bring death and shes just chilling (?)
                    - bad relationship with parents?
                    - whats her personal life even like
    - she still tries to fit in with dragons
    - when she sees people she tries to act threatening
        - usually succeeds just because people are afraid of dragons regardless of what they're doing, really
    - even if she isn't like other dragons she still grew up around them and thus has some of their ideas
    - grew up being told that people are inferior to dragons
        - people are just lesser beings, not nearly as prestigious or powerful or beautiful as any dragon
        - thus dragons can do whatever they want to them and it's justified
    - told that people are hostile towards dragons because they're jealous of their magnificence
        - people are either jealous and attack or jealous and afraid of their prowess

### Personal Life

- family gave her a name that is just wrong
- stereotypical "not like the other dragons" maybe
- doesn't want to hurt people
    - why, what sets her apart from other dragons?
        - most other dragons just accept it?
        - dragon society based off of glory (killing/terrorizing ppl?)
            - maybe not killing specifically but, how much gold you have or whatever
            - so most dragons try to get more gold by just killing rich people or whatever
            - dragons instinctually like shinies?
                - tundra still has that instinct, just pursues it in different ways?
                - oh my god shes autistic i made an autistic dragon
                - yeah that makes sense i fuckin would do that
    - ostracized from most other dragons because she doesn't conform to what they value in a dragon
    - lives far from most other dragons
    - keeps to herself mostly
    - seen as an easy target?
        - dragons don't bother her because she doesn't bother them at all and she just isn't a threat
            - she also just isn't worth killing or anything because there's no prestige there
        - people see her as an easy target?
            - hasn't been attacked yet because she's new in the area?
            - or just, people know she's on her own and far from any other dragons, but she's still a dragon and nearly everyone is still very afraid of that alone
            - combo of both probably
- moved to where she is relatively recently
- was driven out of where she lived previously?
    - by dragons or by people?
